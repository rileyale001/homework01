# Homework 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

# Task

Task for homework is to refactor existing code whike improving it without making changes. It is important that I adhere to the scout ruke of always leaving the code cleaner than when I found it. For this homework I will be increasing the overall accessibility of this webpage so that assistive technologies are able to be utilized by the user. For this assignment I made sure that changes were made to the HTML and CSS.

# HTML

The following changes were made to the HTML:

- title was changed from "title" to a more descriptive and concise title of "Horiseon Digital Marketing".

- Changed div classes to atrributes like header, footer, main, and aside and sections to make the HTML more semantic.

- spacings from the p and listed items were moved so that reader of the HTML document can easily see what supposed to be shown in the document.

- Added nav for the links in the header so that links would work properly and also ensured that in-site links were placed in the proper areas such as putting the id for search-engine optimization in the correct section so that the link would place the reader there.

- Also changed id names to class names so that they were more semantic and could be grouped properly together like id=hero to class=background-image and class=search-engine-opt... to class=content-section

- aria-label and title was add to background-image so that when users put mouse of image it would show what the background image was a Horiseon marketing team and that assistive readers could tell the reader that the background image role was an image.

- other images had alt labels added so that assistive readers would describe the image
